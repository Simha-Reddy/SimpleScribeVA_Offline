# SimpleScribeVA_Offline
A virtual medical scribe that uses Whisper to transcribe dictation or patient visits, entirely on your local computer. This first version allows you to easily combine your transcript with a prompt and then copy it to your clipboard for use with the secure LLM of your choice (such as VA GPT beta) to create a note.
